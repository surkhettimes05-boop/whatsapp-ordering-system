# 🏪 Retailer Onboarding Guide

**Goal:** Get a new Shop Keeper (Retailer) ready to order via WhatsApp in < 2 minutes.

## 📱 Step 1: Save the Number
**Critical:** Retailers MUST save our number to receive broadcast messages and click links.
- **Our Number:** `+977-98XXXXXXXX`
- **Name to Save:** "Wholesale System" or "[Coop Name]"

**Why?** WhatsApp blocks links/buttons coming from unknown numbers to prevent spam.

## 🔗 Step 2: First Hello
1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Send message: `Hi` or `Namaste`.
3. They should receive a **Welcome Menu**.

## 📝 Step 3: Registration (One Time)
1. The bot will ask for **Business Name** and **Location**.
2. Or, if you (Admin) pre-registered them:
   - Provide them their **Retailer ID** or tell them "Just send your phone number".

## 🛍️ Step 4: How to Order
1. **Wait for Broadcast:** "Offers come to you."
2. **View Offer:** Click the "View Deal" button.
3. **Accept:** Reply with Quantity (e.g., "50 cartons").
4. **Confirm:** You will get a confirmation message.
