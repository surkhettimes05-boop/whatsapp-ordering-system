─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DISPUTE TYPE 1: QUALITY ISSUE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENARIO: Retailer claims product quality was poor (damaged, stale, wrong item)

 To help us investigate, can you provide:

 2. Date/time you noticed the issue
 3. What did you expect vs what you got?
 
 Once we have this, we can help resolve."

Wait for response: ________________ Time: ________

STEP 3: IF NO PHOTO / EVIDENCE

If retailer can't provide evidence:

Message: "We understand your concern.
 To process your claim, we need evidence.
 Can you provide photo or description?
 
 If not, we may need to close this without refund.
 (This protects us from fraudulent claims)"

If still no evidence:
□ Document attempt
□ Note: "No evidence provided"
□ Close as UNVERIFIED - NO REFUND (unless high-value/repeat customer)

STEP 4: IF EVIDENCE PROVIDED

Analyze evidence:

□ Photo shows clear quality issue? [YES / NO]
□ Issue consistent with vendor's responsibility? [YES / NO]
□ Can vendor have caused this? [YES / NO]
□ Reasonable claim? [YES / NO]

Quality assessment:

☐ Unclear (could be customer misuse)
☐ Not vendor's fault (shipping damage, etc.)

STEP 5: CONTACT VENDOR

Message to vendor:

Wait for vendor response: ________________ Time: ________

STEP 6: EVALUATE VENDOR RESPONSE

If vendor ADMITS issue:

If vendor DENIES issue:
→ Comparative analysis:
  ☐ Retailer's photo vs Vendor's explanation
  ☐ Check Vendor's past history (repeat issues?)
  ☐ Check Retailer's history (repeat complaints?)

DECISION LOGIC:
  • First-time vendor + new retailer = Trust retailer
  • Vendor reputation = Trust vendor unless evidence clear
  • Repeated issue from same vendor = Believe retailer

STEP 7: FINAL DECISION

☐ APPROVED - Refund/replacement granted
