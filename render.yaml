  # 2. Worker Service (BullMQ)
  # NOTE: Render Free tier doesn't support separate worker services well (they sleep).
  # For MVP/Low cost, we run the worker INSIDE the web service (via app.js scheduler).
  # A separate worker service is better for scale.

# Redis (Render Managed Redis)
# Note: Render Redis is not free after trial. 
# Alternative: Use Internal Redis or external provider if trying to stay 100% free.
# But for production, Managed is best.
# If unavailable in free tier via YAML, user creates manually.
# We will define it here expecting user might need to upgrade or just use it.
# If this fails validation on free tier, remove it and ask user to provide REDIS_URL from elsewhere.
# Render doesn't support Redis in blueprint for free tier usually? Let's check docs mentally.
# Actually, Render has a free Redis tier now!
