FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Q: Do I have to follow these SOPs exactly?
A: Yes, exactly. They're designed for consistency and compliance. Deviations must
   be documented and escalated. If you find issues, propose updates through your
   manager.

Q: What if the SOP doesn't cover my situation?
A: 1) Check if it's covered in multiple SOPs, 2) Escalate to manager, 3) Document
   what happened, 4) Process will be reviewed and SOP updated if needed.

Q: How long should these processes take?
A: Retailer onboarding: 5-10 min | Vendor onboarding: 15-20 min | Incident
   response: 15 min for HIGH, 30 min for MEDIUM | Dispute resolution: 1-3 hours

Q: What if I make a mistake following an SOP?
A: Report it to your manager immediately. All actions are logged anyway. Focus
   on honest reporting vs. hiding mistakes.

Q: Can I skip steps in the checklists?
A: No. Every step exists for a reason (compliance, audit, safety). If a step
   seems unnecessary, discuss with manager.

Q: What if a customer is angry during incident response?
A: Use empathy and transparency. "I understand you're upset. Here's exactly what
   I'm doing to fix it." Follow the incident response templates.

Q: How do I handle situations not in these SOPs?
A: Ask your manager. Don't improvise with high-stakes situations. Better to ask
   for guidance than to create new problems.

Q: Do these SOPs apply to managers too?
A: Yes, managers must also follow them when handling incidents/disputes. Managers
   also have APPROVAL responsibilities outlined in each SOP.

Q: How often are these SOPs updated?
A: Monthly feedback collection, quarterly audits, annual major review. Check
   version number - only follow current version.

Q: What if I find an error in the SOP?
A: Report to your manager immediately. Don't fix it yourself. They'll document
   the issue and include in next quarterly update.
